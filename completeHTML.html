 <!-- what are tags in html
HTML tags are the fundamental building blocks of a web page, used to define the structure and content of a document written in 
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). An HTML tag is composed of:

>>>>An opening tag, which marks the beginning of an element
>>>>Content, which is the information or structure within the element
>>>>A closing tag, which marks the end of the element


The basic structure of an HTML tag is <tagname>Content...</tagname>. Tags can be divided into four categories:

1. Structural tags: Define the overall structure of the document, such as <html>, <head>, and <body>.
2. Semantic tags: Provide meaning to the content, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <article>.
3. Presentational tags: Control the appearance of the content, such as <b>, <i>, <u>, and <font> (although these are deprecated and should be avoided).
4. Interactive tags: Create interactive elements, such as <a> for hyperlinks and <form> for submitting data. -->


<!-- tag is a special word used to define the structure,meaning and formatting of the webpage. -->










    <!-- what are elements in html??

HTML elements are the building blocks of an HTML document, providing structure, semantics, and formatting to the content. 
They are composed of tags, which include an opening tag, content (optional), and a closing tag (except for self-closing or void elements).
 Elements can contain formatting instructions, semantic meaning, and content. -->

     </h1> closing tag -->
