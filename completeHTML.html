 <!-- what are tags in html
HTML tags are the fundamental building blocks of a web page, used to define the structure and content of a document written in 
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). An HTML tag is composed of:

>>>>An opening tag, which marks the beginning of an element
>>>>Content, which is the information or structure within the element
>>>>A closing tag, which marks the end of the element


The basic structure of an HTML tag is <tagname>Content...</tagname>. Tags can be divided into four categories:

1. Structural tags: Define the overall structure of the document, such as <html>, <head>, and <body>.
2. Semantic tags: Provide meaning to the content, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <article>.
3. Presentational tags: Control the appearance of the content, such as <b>, <i>, <u>, and <font> (although these are deprecated and should be avoided).
4. Interactive tags: Create interactive elements, such as <a> for hyperlinks and <form> for submitting data. -->


<!-- tag is a special word used to define the structure,meaning and formatting of the webpage. -->










    <!-- what are elements in html??

HTML elements are the building blocks of an HTML document, providing structure, semantics, and formatting to the content. 
They are composed of tags, which include an opening tag, content (optional), and a closing tag (except for self-closing or void elements).
 Elements can contain formatting instructions, semantic meaning, and content. -->


<!-- <h1> opening tag 
     </h1> closing tag -->




<!DOCTYPE html>    <!-- <!DOCTYPE html> is the method to declare html5    -->
<html lang="en">   <!--   html is working as root element for all the content written between it. -->

<head>       <!-- head tag is used for defining meta data , seo and title. 
             meta can define description, author,stylesheet and many more.-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>     <!-- in this body we will define all the data that is displayed on the website to the user.  -->
    <h1>this is first heading</h1>
    <!-- this h1 is used for making the main heading of the body and the paragraph. -->
    <h2>this is second heading</h2>
    <h3>this is third heading</h3>
    <h4>this is forth heading</h4>
    <h5>this is fifth heading</h5>
    <h6>this is sixth heading</h6>
                  <!-- after h6 tag all h7,8 tags are behaved as paragraph tag -->




                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">youtube.com</a>
<!-- >>>The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
  >>>The <a> tag also supports global attributes in HTML, such as id, class, style, and title.
    >>>The href attribute can be used to link to external pages, internal sections on the same page (using an empty fragment like href="#top"), or email addresses.
    -->

    <!-- Example 1: Linking to an external page-->

<p><a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a></p>

<!-- Example 2: Linking to an internal section -->

<a href="#section1">Go to Section 1</a>





<!-- there are three types of lists.

 <LI>REPEAT</LI>
               </ol>
 <!-- >>> The <ol> tag is used to create an ordered list, which can be numerical or alphabetical.
   >>>The list items are defined using the <li> tag, which can be nested inside the <ol> tag.
    >>> The list items can contain any content, including text, images, and other HTML elements.
    >>> it is ordered list. -->
 
    <!--this should be step wise . it cannot be written according to our choice. -->
